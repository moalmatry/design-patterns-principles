# Shallow vs Deep Copying

By default, object assignment in JavaScript and TypeScript creates a shallow copy, meaning that nested objects are copied by reference rather than by value. If you're cloning an object with nested objects and you want those to be distinct copies (not references), you'll need to implement a deep copy. This can be complex and potentially performance-intensive.

Absolutely, let's consider this in the context of a simple JavaScript object.
