# When To Use The Singleton Pattern

Here are some signs that might indicate that a Singleton pattern could be appropriate:

## Global Variables

If you notice that you're using a global variable to keep some data that should be accessible by many different parts of your system, a Singleton might be an appropriate way to encapsulate that.

## Repeated Initialization

If your code includes repeated, expensive initialization of the same thing (like reading configuration data from a file, setting up a database connection), it might be a good idea to use a Singleton to do this only once and then provide the result to the rest of your system.

## Multiple Access, Single Control

If several parts of your system are accessing and potentially modifying a shared resource, such as a data cache or a system-wide configuration, it could be a code smell that a Singleton pattern would be beneficial to encapsulate access to that resource.

## Non-Uniform Access

If your system contains an entity that is accessed in non-uniform or inconsistent ways across the system, encapsulating that entity into a Singleton can make its use more predictable and manageable.

## Duplicate Instances

If you observe that your system is generating multiple instances of an object, and each of those instances is identical and they do not maintain distinct state, you may want to consider the Singleton pattern. This could be the case if you're managing a resource that should have a single point of control, such as a print spooler or a device driver object.

## Excessive Parameters

If you're passing an instance of an object through several layers of your program just to make it available to a deeply nested component, consider whether this might be a sign that the object could be a Singleton.

Again, it's crucial to remember that Singleton has its downsides and should be used judiciously. It can make code harder to test, and it can introduce unnecessary statefulness and coupling into a system. Always consider whether there are other ways to achieve your goals, such as dependency injection or using a service container, before resorting to Singleton.
