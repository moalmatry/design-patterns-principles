### File Access Issues

If each instance of the Logger class attempts to write to the same log file, you might run into concurrency and file access issues. Multiple instances may cause file writing conflicts where one logger could overwrite the data of another, leading to loss of data and inconsistency.

### Performance

Opening and closing file connections are resource-intensive operations. If each logger opens its file connection, it can put unnecessary stress on the system resources. A single instance sharing the same file connection can be more efficient.

### Consistency

By having a single instance, you can ensure that all parts of your application use the same logging format and write to the same place. If there were multiple logger instances, different parts of your application might log messages differently or to different places.

### Configuration

If each part of your application uses a separate logger, and you want to change something about the logging (like the log format or log level), you would have to find and change every instance of the logger. With a singleton, there's only one place you need to change.
